I've determined that this library isn't a good use of my time/efforts, but wanted to archive the attempt anyway.

Among other implentation difficulties, I found that a required fix was only available in a fork, and it was nontrivial to track the two codebases and merge all the changes I needed into my own version of timesheet.js. That may change someday, but for now I have another library I'd like to try instead.
