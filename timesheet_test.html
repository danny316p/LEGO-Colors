Here's a go at creating <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/126975831@N07/15801189140/">Ryan's chart</a> programatically, because I think doing data entry work in Illustrator is a waste of time.

This is based off of <a href="https://github.com/sbstjn/timesheet.js">https://github.com/sbstjn/timesheet.js</a>, which appears to do most of the work for me. The rest is formatting. I fully expect that thinking of the term "timesheet" instead of "chart" or "timeline" will be the hardest part of this.
